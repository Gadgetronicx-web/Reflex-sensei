Reflexes are very essential to humans since it helps us with exercise, sports and most of our everyday activities. Moreover with good reflex we can potentially evade life threatening situations. Adding to that a good reflex is a good indication of active lifestyle. Considering all the above we have built Reflex sensei , an Arduino powered reflex trainer with multiple features to improve reflex action of the user. The fun part is that this reflex trainer will work like a game so it will competitive, challenging and fun to train.

<b>Game features:</b><br/>

<b>Mode selection:</b><br/>
The game has four modes to choose from which are
- Athletes
- Kids
- Adults
- Aged

<b>Levels:</b><br/>
Each modes will have 4 levels. As levels progress difficultly will be high compared to their lower levels. But the player can only proceed to next level only if they reaches a particular threshold score. The threshold is usually a 70% of the total possible score in a particular level.

Leaderboard:
If a player is successful and scores high they can other players who played he/ she can enter their name in leaderboards. The leaderboard data will be stored in the EEPROM of Arduino. So a player will leave their mark in the game until another player beats him to it. The names of top four leaders will be displayed once a player finishes a game.
